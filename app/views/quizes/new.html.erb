              Should the contract of service mention the practice of overtime rates, employees are entitled to be paid a rate of no less than 1.5 of their hourly salary if they work on normal working days. <br/><br/>

If an employee is required to work on his rest day, he must be paid two times the hourly rate of pay. As for working on public holidays, an employee is entitled to be paid three times the hourly rate of his pay. <br/><br/>

Also, in place of overtime rates, certain companies practice the system of leave replacement credits, whereby an individual can claim a leave day if they work for more than the specified period of hours on a leave day. <br/><br/>

Note: Companies that offer overtime rates will usually mention it in the contract of service that is agreed upon by both the employer and employee at the start of the term of employment. However, if there is no mention of overtime rates in the contract, employers can seek clarifications from their human resource department should the need for it arise.<br/><br/>

             Employees are entitled to paid holiday on the following days:<br/><br/> 
 Eleven of the gazetted public holidays, five of which are: <br/><br/>
- National Day <br/><br/>

- The birthday of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong <br/><br/>
- The Birthday of the Ruler or the Yang di-Pertua Negeri (based on the state the employee works in)<br/><br/>
- Workers' Day<br/><br/> 
- Malaysia Day <br/><br/>

2. On any day appointed as a public holiday under Section 8 of the Holidays Act 1951 which refers to any other day that can be observed as a public holiday as the leader of the state sees fit after consultation with the State Authority. An example would be public holidays for victories in major sports events (badminton, hockey, football, etc.).<br/><br/>

Note that for employers who have already mentioned in their handbook that they do not observe all gazetted public holidays, they are under no statutory obligation to observe certain days that are declared as public holidays. <br/><br/>

For example, the 24th of April 2017 was declared as a public holiday in celebration of the installation of Sultan Muhammad V as the 15th Yang di-Pertuan Agong.<br/><br/> 

However, quite a number of employers did not observe this as a public holiday due to operational requirements or urgencies. As such, employers can require their employees to work on that day but they will have to grant their employees any other day as a paid public holiday in substitution, in line with the Holiday Act 1951. <br/><br/>

If a public holiday falls on a rest day and the following day is a working day, then that day shall be a paid holiday substitution. For example, if a public holiday falls on a Sunday, Monday shall automatically be a public holiday too.<br/><br/>

          <div class="modal-content">
              Annual leave is an addition to rest days and paid holidays. <br/><br/>

An employee is entitled to paid annual leave of:<br/><br/>

- Eight days for every 12 months of continuous service with the same employer if he has been employed for a period of less than two years.<br/><br/> 
- 12 days for every 12 months of continuous service with the same employer if he has been employed for a period of more than two years, but less than five years. <br/><br/>
- 16 days for every 12 months of continuous service with the same employer if he has been employed for a period of five years or more. <br/><br/>

If the individual has not completed 12 months of continuous service with the same employer during the year his contract of service terminates, his paid annual leave must be directly proportionate to the number of completed months of service. Any fraction of the annual leave that is less than one-half of a day will be disregarded, and if it is one-half or more, it shall be counted as one day. <br/><br/>

Sick leave and/or maternity leave is not considered as annual leave. When an employee takes sick leave or maternity leave, the annual leave shall be deemed to have not been taken in respect of the days for which sick leave or maternity leave is so granted.<br/><br/>

If both the employer and employee sign a contract which says that the employee will not take any annual leave, he is then entitled to payment in replacement for the annual leave.<br/><br/>
